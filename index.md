### Greatings! 

I am currently research fellow at RIKEN AIP, working with [A/Prof. Taiji Suzuki](http://ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/suzuki/). Before, I was working as a research associate advised by [Dr. Xin Cao](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-xin-cao) at UNSW and working with [A/Prof. Jie Yin](https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/about/our-people/academic-staff/jie-yin.html) on graph neural network at USYD.

Dr. Huang obtained his Ph.D. degree at Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney working with [A/Prof. Richard Xu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YiDa.Xu). I obtained my Master degree at the department of modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by [Prof. Youjin Deng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yjdeng/).

I also keep a comprehensive and popular blog on the latest Deep Learning Theory works on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/huang-wei-17-47-45).

Please feel free to contact me if you want to cooperate or discuss with me (weihuang[dot]uts[at]gmail[dot]com) on deep learning theory and its application.
