### Greatings! I'm Wei Huang

I obtained my Ph.D. degree at Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney working with [A/Prof. Richard Xu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YiDa.Xu). I obtained my Master degree at the department of modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, working with [Prof. Youjin Deng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yjdeng/).

Please feel free to contact me if you want to cooperate or discuss with me on deep learning theory and its application. Contact information: weihuang.uts@gmail.com.
