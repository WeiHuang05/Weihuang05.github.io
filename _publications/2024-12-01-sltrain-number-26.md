collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-12-01-sltrain-number-26
excerpt: 'Our results show that SLTrain adds minimal extra parameters and memory costs compared to pretraining with low-rank parameterization, 
yet achieves substantially better performance, which is comparable to full-rank training.'
