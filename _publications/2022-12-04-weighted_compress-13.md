excerpt: 'This paper, for the first time, leverages a bi-level formulation to estimate the relative importance of peers with a close-form, to further boost the effectiveness of the distillation from each other. Extensive experiments show the generalization of the proposed framework, 
which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks. '
