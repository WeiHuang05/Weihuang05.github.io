excerpt: 'We formulate the performance of GNNs mathematically with respect to the properties of their edges, 
elucidating how the performance drop can be avoided by pruning negative edges and nonbridges. 
This leads to our simple but effective two-step method for GNN pruning, 
leveraging the saliency metrics for the network pruning while sparsifying the graph with preservation of the loss performance. '
