excerpt: 'We theoretically characterize
the impact of connectivity patterns on the convergence of DNNs under gradient
descent training in fine granularity. By analyzing a wide networkâ€™s Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP), 
we are able to depict how the spectrum of an
NNGP kernel propagates through a particular connectivity pattern, and how that
affects the bound of convergence rates.'
