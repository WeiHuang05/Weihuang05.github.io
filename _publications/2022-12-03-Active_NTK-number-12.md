excerpt: ' In this paper, by exploring the connection between the generalization performance and the training dynamics, we propose a theory-driven deep active learning method (dynamicAL) which selects samples to maximize training dynamics. In particular, we prove that the convergence speed of training and the generalization performance are positively correlated under the ultra-wide condition 
and show that maximizing the training dynamics leads to better generalization performance. '
