Deep learning has been responsible for a step-change in performance across machine learning, 
setting new benchmarks in a large number of applications. During my Ph.D. study, 
I seek to understand the theoretical properties of deep neural networks and close the gap 
between the theory and application sides. This presentation will introduce three concrete 
works with respect to the neural tangent kernel (NTK), one of the seminal advances in deep learning theory recently.
