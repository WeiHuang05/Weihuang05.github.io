Recently researcher find that the dynamics of infinitely-wide neural networks under gradient desent training are captured by neural tangent kernel. With the help of neural tangent kernel, researcher can prove that over-paramterized neural network can find global minimum, which is a milestone in the area of deep learning theory. This talk will present the basic properties of neural tangent kernel and my research output regarding neural tangent kernel.
